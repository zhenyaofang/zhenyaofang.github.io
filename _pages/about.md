I'm currently a Postdoctoral Researcher in Department of Physics at Northeastern University, Boston. I received my PhD in Chemistry at University of Pennsylvania. My research interest includes applying first-principles simulations and machine learning techniques to understand complex phenomena in materials, such as disorder effects, light-matter interactions, and defects.
